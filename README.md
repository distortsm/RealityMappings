# RealityMappings
 
StarMade mappings based on FabricMC's Yarn mappings. Note that these are temporary and will soon be removed as they are no longer needed due to the game no longer being obfuscated. This has only been set up to get Distort working for the time being.

In case you want to mess with it yourself, use the following:
[./gradlew yarn (Mac and Linux)] or [gradlew yarn (Windows)]
